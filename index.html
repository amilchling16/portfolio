    <h2>About Me <span class="emoji">üëãüèª</span></h2>
    <p>Leading UX design and product strategy for agile projects - from inception to completion. I scale complex workflows into intuitive, delightful solutions that address root pain points and yield expanded user adoption. I conduct and analyze research and user testing directly with end users to assure constant accountability in my design process. </p>
    <p>I‚Äôm a problem expert grounded in the long term vision. I adapt to changing business priorities and am quick to understand, synthesize, and deliver results that maintain strategic alignment to the core product vision. I‚Äôm a reliable teammate who is sought after across departments to be a sounding board and solution designer for complex and vague problems. I foster a culture that energizes all stakeholders to embrace the value of user-led product development to ensure the adoptability of relevant, intuitive solutions. </p>
    <p>Beyond my day to day, I enjoy synthesizing my experiences into writing to contribute to the online product design community. Outside of work, I love road tripping in my camper van.</p>

    <p>Getting engineers and product managers on board with iterative design. This is a framework I recommend to any UX designer seeking to impart a dedicated UX focus to agile development teams. I've used it to build and launch new features within quick timelines when co-developing new products for enterprise clients.</p>

    <p>Transparency into the job hunting method I created. November of 2016, I decided to transition out of freelance user experience design. During my job hunt, I collected my favorite questions and wrote thoughtful and exhaustive answers, creating a list of frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/user-testing-without-users-cc42ad130b76" target="_blank">User Testing Without Users</a></h3>
    <p>User testing and usability studies are as important on day one as they are when you have millions of users. When your internal resources are virtually non-existent, you still have a few great ways to understand your target audience and start testing how they‚Äôll relate to your young idea.</p>
