        <h2>Site Mapping</h2>
        <p>I came to this project as the company was looking to push its idea to 2.0. The goal was for 2.0 to be strong enough to garner new investor support while being extendable to a public user base. The existing 1.0 version was created with zero design influence, so it needed to be restructured from the core. New users would be coming into this app with expectations constructed from existing social platforms, so my job was to make this process smooth and inviting.</p>
        <p>First, I created a site map of the existing site in order to fully understand the current scope and organization of content. I cut out redundencies, tightened the flow, and changed the layout of information on every page. My final revised site map complemented industry standards while making the value proposition of this app clear to grasp.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>In reworking the information architecture of a SaaS product, my goal is always to have each existing feature not only become more discoverable, but also more adoptable - creating experiences that aren’t just easy to understand, but that connect value to users so that engagement is fostered and retention is locked in. This product was entering into a space with very prominent competition (Snapchat, Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook, etc), so every feature needed to be simplified and intriguing.</p>
        <p>The most challenging feature to work with was the analytics. This was the most unique value over existing social platforms, but it was also the most foreign. In order to entice users to interact with this feature I made it prominent and unique. I dedicated a third of the dashboard real estate to analytics to impart that it was a major component of the app. I renamed the analytics to a new term, “pStats” so that users could quickly identify that it was new, different, and worth exploring. I also incorporated much more helpful content to ensure that each type of user would have the chance to grasp the value proposition of the app, since it was so deeply rooted there in pStats.</p>

        <h2>Wireframing</h2>
        <p>I was in a unique position, as the company had hired a UI designer before they hired me, the UX designer. The UI designer had translated the 1.0 site page-for-page to a new visual design. No updates were made to the actual content nor navigation. In translating my site mapping into updated pages, I created wireframes within this new UI.</p>

      </div>


      <div class="case-study">
        <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
        <p>My wireframing quickly took high fidelity form thanks to the upfront UI guidelines I was given. I was able to develop rapid prototypes to test early and often in my design process. The most influential insight from testing was discovering that users expected to see all of their content in a gallery, much like other social media sites. This was something version 1.0 did not provide, so I made sure it was prominent in 2.0.</p>
        <p>The second most influential insight from user testing helped decide how received content was handled. The positive positioning of this app made receiving content from other users much more mindful than existing social platforms - users had to actively view each piece before it appeared on their profile. Test users initially received this content in an “inbox”. That nomenclature proved to be confusing because users expected to also be able to generate content from this page, much like sending and receiving within the context of an email inbox. So I rebranded this screen as “notifications”. </p>
        <p>Labeling as notifications created a few key wins. With a notifications icon, users clearly understood that this screen was only for viewing, not for completing an action. Also, since the bell icon that symbolizes notifications was already an ingrained concept, users were extremely interested in checking their notifications, leading to faster adoption of this part of the app. The final big win was that the scope of the scope of this feature could easily evolve within the current navigation, making for smoother feature releases in the future.</p>
