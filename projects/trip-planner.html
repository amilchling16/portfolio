        <h1>Trip Planner</h1>
      </div>

      <!-- CONTENT -->
      <div class="case-study">
        <h2>Problem: No holistic trip planner exists for backpackers</h2>
        <p>The basis of this project was a PDF containing over 60 data points. My job was to take these ideas and develop them into a product that helps backpackers of all skill levels prepare for fun and safe trips. I was to develop the product strategy and interaction design. This was the first phase of this project. My 1.0 design would go on to frame backend development and also be the foundation for later UI design guidelines.</p>

        <h2>Hypothesis: A valuable tool will require a long list of capabilities</h2>
        <p>There was a whole range of information that I needed to validate: data that seemed vital to have front and center, data that could be automated and processed without user input behind the scenes, and data that had no apparent benefit for the user. I considered the planning process a target user would go through and mocked up my first attempt at a user flow to kick things off. Because of how much data was going on, planning out the function structure happened in a spreadsheet even before the wireframing process began.</p>
        

        <h2>User Feedback: Determining a more accurate user flow</h2>
        <p>The first target user I talked with was a very well known backpacker. His initial reaction to the project was that it was a waste of time. As is the case with other advanced-level backpackers, he uses a series of elaborate spreadsheets to plan his trips and was content with this method. But he was happy to give me both his negative feedback, and feedback as it related to his client base of less experienced hikers.</p>
        <p>My biggest takeaway from his feedback was understanding the pace in which people planned their trips. Because so much went into planning, it wasn't something that was done in one sitting. At the request of my client, the first iteration of the trip planner design was a single page. The cognitive load for the user was overwhelming. The feedback I received gave me the leverage I needed to finally convert my client to an updated architecture where each step was split out onto it’s own page.</p>
        <p>I also talked with people who fell into both our target early adopters segment (experienced, ultralight backpackers) as well as the eventual majority user group we were aiming for ("REI hikers” with less experience). This collective feedback helped me rearrange and update the trip planning process so that the flow was a more natural fit and the priority level for each feature was more balanced.</p>

        <h2>Iterating: Course corrections for a more approachable product</h2>
        <p><span class="bold">Content Hierarchy -</span>The flow and nomenclature of the planning process did not match up to reality. I wound up reworking the process:</p>
        <ul id="bullets">
          <li id="bullets">Tripmates were added at the beginning of the trip planner because users felt that collaborating with their tripmates was a central part of the planning process.</li>
          <li id="bullets">Emergency planning was updated to take into consideration both third party emergency planning and people’s desire to have their emergency contacts very well informed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="bold">Navigation and Pacing -</span>Each step of the trip planner became clearly packaged in a collection of pages. I added a side navigation bar to show the progress of each step and to allow the user to skip around to what they wanted to tackle during a single session. </p>
        <p><span class="bold">Packing Lists -</span>I brought together the previously siloed gear (tent, boots, etc) and consumables (food, fuel, etc) inventories. I also de-prioritized advanced information for each. The original design was overly complex, difficult to navigate around, and gave priority to edge cases: people who were obsessed with cataloging their gear and cutting down weight. The update emphasized a more normal use case: people simply not wanting to forget what they to pack for their trip.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Immediate Payout - </span>Once a user completed the large and exciting task of planning their trip, their trip view page was the succinct result that include even more valuable information than what they had manually entered. It was important for the value of the planning to be immediately clear. I designed this page to be easy to navigate. It was also downloadable into a simplified PDF format to print and carry in the field.</p>

        <h2>Reflection: Refining the process and future priorities</h2>
        <p>This was my first development handoff that did not involve a meeting or presentation. The communication culture of this team was written communication only - mainly through Slack and Trello. I learned that everything I didn’t explicitly record was missed. For things like error messaging, upload interactions, and photo cropping, I had to create detailed documentation. Moving forward, my documentation will be much more extensive and I will also share the greater context using storytelling to make new projects more approachable to developers.</p>
        <p>Knowing now that user research would end up being a scarce resource, if I could redo how I approached 1.0, it would be to do more user research upfront. This would have brought me to the conclusions regarding flow and nomenclature much earlier in the design process.</p>
        <p>What I am certain of needing to focus on next with this project is improving upon collaborative trip planning. As it stands, we have a very ambiguous relationship between the trip creator and the tripmates they invite to access the trip. I would like to create a clearer understanding of the way collaborative editing works. I would also like to expand features like checklists, packing lists, and food planning to be equipped for successful group planning.</p>
