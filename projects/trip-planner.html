        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>My job was to translate a PDF containing over 60 data points into a trip planner for backpackers. The initial screens I worked on were the input form, the Create Trip screen, and the Trip View screen where users could use the data to have a successful trip. My initial deliverables were high fidelity wireframes that could be sent off to both a developer and a UI designer.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="case-study">
        <h2>Data Cataloging</h2>
        <p>Although the PDF had all of the information I needed to complete this project, I started by creating a more concise inventory of the data points. All of the data was to be input on the Create Trip screen, but my next task was to decide which data would be important to show on the Trip View screen.</p>
        <p>Next I prioritized each data point that would appear on the Trip View screen. Which data would display exactly as it was submitted? Which data would evolve into a more useful visual interpretation to add maximum value for the user?</p>
      </div>

      <div class="case-study">
        <h2>Mental Model</h2>
        <p>The last step on my spreadsheet was to establish the priority of each data point. Which data points were a high priority? Which were important, but could be partially hidden within the UI? To figure this out and to be able to start wireframing, I had to understand the mental model behind the target user.</p>
        <p>Although I had made assumptions while sorting the data, I dove more narrowly into the mindset of a person who would be planning a backpacking trip. I talked with several people who enjoyed backpacking and camping to varying degrees. From there, I was able to establish the expected user flow for creating a new trip.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="case-study">
        <h2>Content Hierarchy</h2>
        <p>Once my spreadsheet was signed off on, I started organizing the content in low fidelity wireframes. For the Create Trip screen, I framed a step by step process that would meet the needs of both my client and target users. For the Trip View screen, I was able to make progress toward a utilitarian output.</p>

      <div class="case-study">
        <h2>Cognitive Load</h2>
        <p>The biggest challenge of this project was the volume of data being collected. I was able to talk with my client to eliminate a few fields, but ultimately a lot of information is needed to yield a comprehensive trip.</p>
        <p>One of my objectives was to create the Cretae Trip experience on a single page. To ensure that users would successfully endure the entire Create Trip form, I knew having the form on a single page was a risky move. However, there were ways to make this single page dynamic enough to create a steady pace for the user. I employed a few tactics to set the form up for success. I added a progress bar to chart navigation throughout the page. And, later in my developer and designer notes, I denoted a hybrid lazy loading screen that would disable form input until previous forms were entered.</p>

      <div class="case-study">
        <h2>Development and UI Design Notes</h2>
        <p>I created limited prototypes, mood boards, and annotated versions of the final wires as part of the hand-off to the developer and UI designer. These annoteated versions denote the intended interaction design and my recommendations for translating these screens into a successful final product.</p>
