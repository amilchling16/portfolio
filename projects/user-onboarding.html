        <h2>Problem: The signup process created a large barrier to entry</h2>
        <p>In need of a user interface redesign, but without development resources to make big changes, I was tasked with creating a quick-win, light-development solution to improve the first time user experience of a multi-platform app. The solution needed to be completed within a single, 5-day sprint cycle.</p>
        <p>My specific task was to mitigate the existing signup flow's known pain points. My objective in doing so was yield an onboarding experience that would increase adoption and long-term retention. This would be a big improvement for users, while buying us time before we were able to release <a href="/projects/productivity-app" target="_blank">a total UI overhaul</a>.</p>

      </div>

        <h2>Hypothesis: A simple onboarding update would be an impactful interim fix</h2>
        <p>I created an updated user flow to map every step of the process. The issues I had discovered from user support feedback were challenging and in need of thorough, long-term solutions. However, if I was able to call out the overarching pain points before a user interacted with them, I believed a positive impact could be achieved more immediately.</p>

        <h2>User Feedback: Requirements born from the user support archives</h2>
        <ul id="bullets">
          <li id="bullets">Create a streamlined signup process by simplifying the content architecture of the pricing page.</li>
          <li id="bullets">Provide a progress bar. The users' primary job to be done was to increase their productivity, so I wanted a quick and effective process to uphold that objective from the very beginning.</li>
          <li id="bullets">Gain insights into intended use cases by providing a one question survey. We were still getting to know our user base, so this was a way for us to inform future customizations without stretching the responsibilities of anyone on our team.</li>
          <li id="bullets">Spend greater focus on the connection between the web app and local desktop app. Increased emphasis would decrease churn of first time users.</li>
          <li id="bullets">Take new users through the real UI in order to connect them to the real-life functionality, instead of leading them through abstract screens. This provided greater value in that it familiarized users with the app earlier than before.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Little Changes: Reconciling sign up with the user flow</h2>
        <p>After talking with the developer who would be implementing my solution, I decided to create an onboarding experience that mimicked real use via a hands-on walkthrough. This format would allow us to shorten development time by recycling the existing UI. Tooltips were the chosen method for the post-signup tutorial. They would be easy for a developer to overlay, and if need be, we could choose a third party service to create the tooltips code-free.</p>
        <p>I rearranged the flow to comply with the redefined user flow, imbedding newly configured steps into the existing UI.</p>

      </div>

        <h2>Challenges: Working in a redesigned pricing page </h2>
        <p>Because this was a low-effort, high-reward project, I was able to hand off simple mockups to guide the front-end developer. The largest issue to address was the confusing pricing page. I created a simple front end layout redesign. The upgraded content hierarchy improved scannability while creating a more intuitive differentiation between the payment options. For the tutorial that followed, I simply mapped out the new steps over screenshots of the existing UI.</p>

        <h2>Reflection: There must be more quick wins out there</h2>
        <p>My biggest takeaway from this project was how efficient it could be to provide incremental upgrades to user experience issues. This perspective helped me mature in my thoughts toward product strategy. Because user research tends to affect product evolution in unpredictable ways anyway, it became obvious to me that quick fixes had the potential to be very important opportunities. Executing on tiny changes with big impacts had cost less than running after the current "Perfect Dream Solution". This understanding was better for both the product and my emotional stake in the design process.</p>
