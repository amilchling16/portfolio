        <h2>Audience Definition</h2>
        <p>I was tasked with creating a user-friendly team management app based off of a conceptual prototype and a list of desired features. The app was to have both desktop and mobile versions.</p>
        <p>The audience for this app was split into two groups. The first target audience was coaches of children’s sports teams. The second audience was professionals who would use this app as a human resources tool in order to manage their coworkers. Although the first release would be as a coaching app, my design would have to be easily translatable to a professional team management app for it’s second release.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="case-study">
        <h2>Competitor and Industry Research</h2>
        <p>There was a unique value proposition to this app (positive focus and integration into a unique social platform), but the core features were similar to existing solutions. I studied similar products that focused on coaching, human resources management, manager-subordinate relationships, and personnel-related record keeping.</p>
        <p>The main takeaway from my research was that no solution provided a prominent relational component (messaging) alongside recording notes and collecting stats. I would need to prioritize the positive messaging component of our app, while ensuring that it fit well within the familiar construct of existing team management products.</p>

      <div class="case-study">
        <h2>Prototyping and Usability Testing</h2>
        <p>As I worked through each set of wireframes, I uploaded them to Invision to create interactive prototypes to test. I used UserTesting.com to screened for testers who had experience managing teams. The following insights were the most impactful to the design:</p>
      <ul id="bullets">
          <li id="bullets">Testers found the most value in the “Today’s Goals” screen, so I moved it to become the home screen when logging into the app.</li>
          <li id="bullets">Special feature names within the app were confusing and unnecessary barriers to user understanding. I updated to a more conventional nomenclature. For terms that were unique to the app, I created more upfront and discoverable ways to quickly introduce them to new users.</li>
          <li id="bullets">The coach/manager role within the app was clear, but it was harder to understand for players/subordinates. Both the onboarding and message sending features of the app evolved to have a clearer description of how sent messages would be received.</li>
          <li id="bullets">In early, low fidelity prototypes, testers first impressions were uncertain regarding the capabilities of the app. I pulled the app interface into the earliest part of the user experience to create immediate visibility into the functionality.</li>
          <li id="bullets">I observed that several functions needed to be accessed by the user on a much less frequent basis than initially assumed. I was able to declutter the navigation bar to create focus around the most highly trafficked options.</li>

        <h2>Onboarding Strategy and UI Design</h2>
        <p>The signup requirements for this app required email validation and a lot of data collection. It was my job to create a warm UI with inviting graphics. I made sure to mitigate the user taxation by creating a delightful, brief, and transparent signup flow.</p>
