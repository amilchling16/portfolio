          <h4>CHALLENGE</h4>
          <p>In the early stages of the company, we were without a product team to guide development. The result was a product with user experience shortcomings that had yet to be folded into the pipeline. The client success team was the interim solution for ensuring users adoption while the product could not yet stand alone. This made client success an integral part of the product for each client. Each strategist’s role was to not only relay email marketing best practices, but also teach clients how to use the product.

          <address>Existing design</address>
          <p>As it stood, phone communication between strategists and clients was the primary way clients were accessing information about the product. The support site was long abandoned and very outdated. I decided that we needed to reincarnate the support site as a useful tool to create autonomy for clients, ensuring that they would more quickly find value in the product and be retained users.
</p>

          <h4>PROCESS</h4>
          <p>First I did an audit of the existing support site. I slashed what was no longer relevant, saving the articles that would be updated and reformatted. I met with the tech specialist to ensure that the technical documentation was also minimized and updated.  
          </p>
          <p>
          During my audit, I realized that we had a hidden product feature buried in our app that the team was previously unaware of. The application was linking to support articles individually defining key terms. In order to make this feature reliable, I updated the term definitions, linking them together with both a single “table of contents” style document and tags so that they would be easier and more intuitive to explore.
           </p><p>
          Next, I took stock of what was missing from the documents that were left. I asked the rest of the team for the FAQs they felt they were explaining over and over again and added them to my list of essential documentation we needed to have be accessible.

          </p>
          <p>
         With all of the FAQs mapped out, I updated the information architecture of the entire site. I reorganized categories, added <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wu3_qlSMWSCT1TbX_jVeP9U4f0-Mo_5y3mkS6TtfP4U/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" alt="Sample 1">new</a> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TPQ72zzdABJgTRjVxB_Jk7umT9PUoV6JCW2RBPqg6tc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" alt="Sample 2">ones</a>, and organized them in a flow from onboarding, to basic troubleshooting, through advanced strategies.
          </p>
           <div id="one">
            <img src="../images/supportwhiteboard.jpg">
          </div>
          <p>To keep the team enthusiastic about this new resource I was making, I outlined my master plan of all of the new articles I would create organized under the new category structure. This list was drawn up on our office whiteboard to create visible accountability and a clear timeline of when new support articles would be available for use. I prioritized by quarter, checking off each article as it became live.</p>
          <p>Then I began writing new articles. I asked a few colleagues to contribute, editing their articles and ensuring that each followed the same consistent formatting for ease of use by our clients.</p>
          <p>
          Finally, I did a complete overhaul of the site in order to sync it with the company’s brand guidelines. I learned Liquid to edit the UI. This update boosted the sites legitimacy, making it more inviting.
           </p>
          <h4>OUTCOME</h4>
          <p>The support site became a reliable tool that we immediately started sharing with clients. Non-strategy phone calls were cut, as clients were directed to the intuitive, self-service resources. We found that the information was more easily retained when clients were given it in writing, rather than over the phone.
          </p>

          </div>
          <address>Updated UI before recategorization</address>
          <p>
          The surprise benefit of this project was that the support site became a resource for our internal team as well. Within client success, these articles became a training resource. For the sales department, associates could look up the details of a particular feature to more easily explain it to prospects. The marketing and product teams both recycled the content into thought leadership content visible to the public.
