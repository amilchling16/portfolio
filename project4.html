          <h4>BACKGROUND</h4>
          <p>In the early stages of the company, customer support resources were a critical factor in the success of a B2B SaaS product. </p><p>

The existing support site was outdated and unfinished. As a member of the Client Success department, I saw an opportunity to build out the support site in order to create an accurate and dependable resource. The goal was to increase autonomy in client product usage by providing an alway-accessible knowledge base.

</p>
          
          

          <h4>SITE MAPPING</h4>
          <p>I performed an audit of the existing support site, sorting articles that needed to go, stay, or be updated. I delegated the technical documentation audit to a technical support specialist.
          </p>
          <p>During my audit I uncovered a live, hidden feature in the product that was directly linked to a subset of now outdated articles. Updating these became a prioritized project, as the articles were linked directly to real product users.o explore.
           </p><p>
          Because there was no existing categorization, I added my own. Based on existing common pain points and frequently asked questions, I mapped out the extent of information needed. I organized the existing content within these new categories and collected a list of missing content.
          </p>
         
          <h4>CONTENT HIERARCHY</h4>
          <p>With all of the FAQs mapped out, I took the first step in updating the architecture of the site. I organized categories in an order that mimicked client flow: from onboarding, to basic troubleshooting, through advanced strategies.
          </p>

          </div>
          <h4>CONTENT CREATION</h4>
          <p>I outlined my master plan of all of the new articles that needed to be created. I drew it up on the office whiteboard to create visible accountability and a clear timeline of when new support articles would be live and available for the team to use. I prioritized by quarter, checking off each article as it became live.
          </p>
          <h4>UI STANDARDIZATION</h4>
          <p>To take the organization a step further, I reworked the whole UI. I learned Liquid templating language to bring the UI up to brand standards and increase the legitimacy of the experience.</p><p>

Each article received a standardized format and design to create a consistent and delightful experience across the site. </p>

          <h4>SEARCH AND BROWSE NAVIGATION</h4>
          <p>
          While the site mapping provided an intuitive way to browse, I had to account for search navigation as well. I added search terms to every article, making sure to add the nomenclature of every audience within our client base. The common nomenclature of marketers, CEOs, engineers, and small business owners was all incorporated to guarantee a smooth search experience.</p><p>

To make searching and browsing even more optimized, I added related pages, covering all bases for those looking for content that may be nestled under different parent categories.
          </p>

          <h4>UNEXPECTED OUTCOMES</h4>
<p>The support site became an immediately reliable tool to clients. Direct contact with team customer service team decreased as a result of our new, self-service resource. We found that the information was more easily retained when clients were given it in writing, rather than over the phone.</p><p>

The surprise benefit of this project was that the knowledge base became an internal resource as well. Within client success, these articles became a training resource. For the sales department, associates could look up the details of a particular feature to more easily explain it to prospects. The marketing and product teams recycled the articles into thought-leading inbound marketing content and blog posts.</p>
