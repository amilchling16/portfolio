          <h4>CHALLENGE</h4>
          <p>After analyzing thousands of customer support cases, it became apparent that a large segment of new users did not know how to use the app and its functions. Our existing onboarding was oversimplified and disconnected from the app itself, making it hard to understand a) how to download all components and b) how to use features together to make the app work.</p>
          <div id="two">
             <img src="../images/onboardingold1.jpg">
             <br><img src="../images/onboardingold2.jpg"><br>
             <img src="../images/onboardingold3.jpg">
          </div>
          <address>Existing process</address>
          <p>With the onboarding came confusion about the pricing. The current pricing information was hidden from both prospects and users. Its organization was indigestible, making it confusing for users to find value in paid options - especially when they had no insights into the app beforehand.</p>
          <p>My task was to make onboarding a more educational and welcoming experience. I was to design a simpler flow using the existing components for a process that was more intuitive than burdensome for the user, while not requiring too much front end work for our two-person dev team.</p>
          <h4>PROCESS</h4>
          <p>I started this project by first studying our own onboarding. I identified the main pain points for our users. The issue that stood out most, besides the out-of-context payment plan selection, was that the last step prompted users to perform a task found in the app, but in an ambiguous, oversimplified context. This felt like a step back when, once selected, users were dropped into the UI for the first time and were left trying to grapple with an unrelated environment. 
          </p>
          <div id="two">
             <img src="../images/onboardingvimeo.jpg">
          </div>
          <p>
          After I had my list of concerns, I conducted industry research, studying what made onboarding experiences successful and what did not. I signed up for many products, identifying which parts of their experience would be useful to my product. I found Vimeo’s onboarding and pricing to be my most inspirational resource, along with UserOnboard. 
           </p>
           <div id="two">

             <img src="../images/onboardingwireframe2.jpg">
          </div><p>
         I began to layout the standards I wanted to apply to our onboarding. My wishlist included a progress bar, categorized feature lists, less text and more visual explanations, tool tips, and a tour of the application that was most similar to how a user would use the app on their own. I also added a survey to bring in data for us to better understand the demographic of our current userbase and to shed light on possible growth strategies for the future.

          <p>The ultimate design I created utilized the existing UI within the app, while adding a new pricing page that could also repurposed as an outward-facing marketing page.
          <p>
          The new pricing page displayed the differentiation in plan tiers with an immediate image, and navigating the specific feature nuances was easier with the categorical separation below.

          The onboarding tool tip tour is helpful in explaining the current phase of our app design. Leading the new user through the schedule in the proper way allows for users to understand the interaction between the separate modules. It also explains the scope of use for each specific module - this had been undiscoverable in the past design.
