          <h4>CHALLENGE</h4>
          <p>Despite high downloads, we were not hitting the retention numbers we were after. Through interviewing power users and reviewing the customer support data it became apparent that many people were not fully understanding how the app works prior to downloading. We were driven by our legacy products and hype, but our website's hompage was not serving as a powerful tool.</p> 
          <p>Because of the homepage, the scope of the product's features was unknown. Our messaging was unclear and without value-adding images. Much of the content alluded to the older versions of the product. In order to detach and prove the value of the newly released product, my task was to add more concrete content for people to instantaneously grasp the concept and value of the product. A fresher page needed to be created with new content and a competitive SEO strategy.
</p>
           <div id="one">
            <address>Existing design</address>

          </div>

          <h4>PROCESS</h4>
          <p>I reviewed the user research and made a list of the pain points that would be appropriate to address within the setting of the homepage. I knew off the bat that we were in need of adding product images, keywords, and jargon-free content to create a clearer picture of the product for prospective users.
          </p>
           <p>
          In the initial phase of redesign, I ran AB tests and discovered through the service’s heatmap feature that a high percentage of visitors were clicking through to the FAQ page. It was clear that our current homepage design was leaving people with an inadequate explanation of the app. We needed to add valuable, educational content to foster an increase in qualified downloads.
           </p>
         
         <p>
         In order to format new content correctly, I studied other product homepages. I looked first at competitors and then at successful B2C SaaS products within in the industry. I was looking to find design and content trends. I discovered that there is an almost standardized approach to product homepages. I created a list of the “best practice” features consumers expect when they land on a new product’s homepage. I found the best examples of these and collected them all as inspiration. 

          </p>
           <div id="one">
            <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/amj516/product-website/" target="_blank"><img src="../images/homepagepin.jpg"></a>
          </div>
          <p>
          Within this redesign process, I realized that there was an important development opportunity that would be a big win for users, but would not require the development of a new feature. By expanding on more preset values within the block feature, we would be improving on the highest used function within the backend structure we already had in place.
          </p>
          <div id="two">
            <img src="../images/homepagewireframe1.jpg">
            <img src="../images/homepagewireframe2.jpg">
          </div>
          <h4>OUTCOME</h4>
          <p>The standard features that we were missing out on where: product screenshots, download buttons, clear device support, a visible signup form, a link to pricing, illustration of product use, and icons visualizing the spectrum of features. I set out wireframing these ideas in order to figure out the best way to succinctly arrange these components on our homepage.

          </p>
          <p>
          The resulting high fidelity wireframe displays a more holistic snapshot of the product, what it does, what it looks like, and how it can be used. By creating a more transparent lense into the product, this design primes prospects to be qualified downloaders, creating a stronger chance for fast user adoption. 
          </p><p>
          The comprehensive breadth of information listed and the reorganization and addition of links boosts the homepages credibility, making it an accurate ambassador to the product.
