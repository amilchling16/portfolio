          <h4>CHALLENGE</h4>
          <p>The existing version of this productivity app was composed of several modules housing individual features. This isolated configuration created a confusing disconnect, making it hard for a user to understand how it was supposed to work. This frustrating and confusing experience proved to be too daunting for the average user to overcome on their own.</p>
          <div id="one">
            <img src="../images/apporiginal.jpg">
          </div>
          <address>Existing design</address>
          <p>Busy users expected this productivity tool to be simple and fast to use. In order to deliver this expected experience, I needed to design a dashboard with an instantly understandable workflow of unified features, keeping in mind that our small team needed to recycle as much of the existing design as possible to cut development time. The goal was to pinpoint the exact areas of disconnect and provide both a quick fix and a long term redesign solutions.</p>

          <h4>PROCESS</h4>
          <p>My first task was to fully understand where the breakdown was happening for our users. Which design decisions were unnecessary hurdles that we could remove with a new iteration? I went through thousands of customer support inquiries, tagging the issues that were related to the web app.  
          </p>
          <center><iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/zoYS4RwaIVJ2cF" width="595" height="485" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen> </iframe></center>
          
          <p>
          The overarching issue I discovered related to this project was that the relationship between the two main features (creating “blocks”, then scheduling them) were not understood. The second scheduling step was given greater visual hierarchy than the first step. This created an apparent flow that was directly opposite of the correct sequence needed to successfully use the tool. 
           </p>
          <div id="three">
            <img src="../images/appsketch1.jpg">
            <img src="../images/appsketch2.jpg">
            <img src="../images/appsketch3.jpg">
          </div>
           <p>
          I knew that the relationship between those two features needed to be improved. But before I started working at that level, I took a deeper look at each feature individually. For the “blocks feature”, I had discovered in my customer support research that many people did not understand the scope of its function. I needed to more clearly display the standard use cases so that users could fully utilize it. I also found that there were some redundancies in the “scheduling feature” that once removed, would create a simpler experience.
          </p>
          <div id="one">
            <img src="../images/appwhiteboard.jpg">
          </div>
          <p>
          Within this redesign process, I realized that there was an important development opportunity that would be a big win for users, but would not require the development of a new feature. By expanding on more preset values within the block feature, we would be improving on the highest used function within the backend structure we already had in place.
          </p>
          <div id="one">
            <img src="../images/appblockupdate.jpg">
          </div>
          <div id="one">
            <img src="../images/appblocklistupdate.jpg">
          </div>
          <address>Wireframe and high fidelity mockup for existing block module</address>
          <p>
          After identifying the pain points of each feature individually and their interaction as a whole, I began to sketch out updates that would improve the experience. I learned that our oversimplified design for the settings was actually not making the experience simpler. There were components that needed to be added in order to differentiate tasks and create an automatically intuitive experience.
           </p>
          <h4>OUTCOME</h4>
          <div id="one">
            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5h9s-4lqyxHc3pQdDFjNXdaVlE/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><img src="../images/appbutton.jpg"></a>
          </div>
          <p>By using the same footprint, the changes would not cause a drastic learning curve for existing users. Later, the columns could be reversed in order for the entire dashboard to present the features in complete sequential order.
          </p>
          <div id="two">
            <a href="../images/appfinalmockup.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/appfinalmockup.jpg"><a>
              <a href="../images/appmockup.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/appmockup.jpg"><a>
          </div>
          <address>A unified block and scheduling module with updated device and session modules to more clearly display settings</address>
          <p>
          Ultimately it was decided that having the two features in separate modules was not going to work, so I combined the two features within the same module. This helped convey the relationship between the two features, eliminating all guesswork on how they interact.
          </p><p>
          With this intuitive flow, users could become less dependent on tool tips and supplementary resources to successfully use the app. The new design would aid in speedier user adoption, creating a larger, more self-sufficient userbase.</p>
